--[ EASY ] Author-Book Relationship Using Joins and Basic SQL Operations
--1.	Design two tables â€” one for storing author details and the other for book details.
--2.	Ensure a foreign key relationship from the book to its respective author.
--3.	Insert at least three records in each table.
--4.	Perform an INNER JOIN to link each book with its author using the common author ID.
--5.	Select the book title, author name, and author's country.

CREATE TABLE TB_AUTHOR( 
AUTHOR_ID INT PRIMARY KEY, 
AUTHOR_NAME VARCHAR(30)); 
  
CREATE TABLE TB_BOOK( 
BOOK_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,  
BOOK_TITLE VARCHAR(30),  
AUTHOR_ID INT,  
FOREIGN KEY (AUTHOR_ID) REFERENCES 
TB_AUTHOR(AUTHOR_ID)); 
 
INSERT INTO TB_AUTHOR (AUTHOR_ID, AUTHOR_NAME) 
VALUES 
(1, 'jay shankar'), 
(2, '23bcs10408'), 
(3, 'krg_1B'); 
 
INSERT INTO TB_BOOK (BOOK_ID, BOOK_TITLE, AUTHOR_ID) 
VALUES 
(101, 'Database Systems', 1),

--[ MEDIUM ] Department-Course Subquery and Access Control.
--1.	Design normalized tables for departments and the courses they offer, maintaining a foreign key relationship.
--2.	Insert five departments and at least ten courses across those departments.
--3.	Use a subquery to count the number of courses under each department.
--4.	Filter and retrieve only those departments that offer more than two courses.
--5.	Grant SELECT-only access on the courses table to a specific user.
-- Step 1: Create Tables
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES Departments(department_id)
);

-- Step 2: Insert Data into Departments
INSERT INTO Departments (department_id, department_name) VALUES
(1, 'Computer Science'),
(2, 'Mechanical Engineering'),
(3, 'Electrical Engineering'),
(4, 'Civil Engineering'),
(5, 'Mathematics');

-- Step 3: Insert Data into Courses
INSERT INTO Courses (course_id, course_name, department_id) VALUES
(101, 'Data Structures', 1),
(102, 'Operating Systems', 1),
(103, 'Machine Learning', 1),
(104, 'Thermodynamics', 2),
(105, 'Fluid Mechanics', 2),
(106, 'Circuits and Systems', 3),
(107, 'Control Systems', 3),
(108, 'Structural Analysis', 4),
(109, 'Linear Algebra', 5),
(110, 'Calculus', 5),
(111, 'Probability Theory', 5);

-- Step 4: Count Number of Courses per Department

SELECT 
    department_name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) 
     FROM Courses c 
     WHERE c.department_id = d.department_id) AS course_count
FROM Departments d;

-- Step 5: Filter Departments Offering More Than 2 Courses
SELECT 
    department_name,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) 
     FROM Courses c 
     WHERE c.department_id = d.department_id) AS course_count
FROM Departments d
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) 
       FROM Courses c 
       WHERE c.department_id = d.department_id) > 2;
